git checkout A;

To remove everything in branch A and make it to be the same as B:

git reset B --hard;

If you need to discard all your local changes (kind of revert, but doesn't mess up git like git revert):

git reset HEAD --hard;

When you are done, don't forget to update your remote branch (use --force or -f flag in case you need to override history).

git push origin A -f;
