For rollback escenario create a backup for master branch in case it not exists (masterRollback)
Update masterRollback branch from master branch
Update master branch from release branch (without pushing the changes yet, this will be done in step 5, for the release branch name check the CM Jira ticket or ask to QA team)
Create or delete the tag on any remote before you push
You can list the current tags

Here is a last resort idea (it's dirty and not a git way of doing things)...

    Go to branch B (git checkout B).
    Copy all the content of that branch(ctrl + c)
    Go to branch A (git checkout A)
    Delete everything from branch A (select all with mouse and delete)
    Copy all the content from the branch B in the folder where all the branch A stuff was. (ctrl + v)
    Stage all the new changes (git add .)
    Commit the staged changes (git commit -m "Branch A is now the same as B")
